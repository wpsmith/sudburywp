=== WPMU Ldap Authentication ===
Contributors: axelseaa
Tags: ldap, authentication, multisite
Requires at least: 3.2
Tested up to: 3.9.x
Stable tag: wpmu-ldap_4.0.2

A plugin to override the core WordPress authentication method in order to use a LDAP server for authentication.  Currently only supported on MultiSite.

== Description ==

[New Feature Request Site](http://wpmuldap.uservoice.com/ "WPMU LDAP Authentication Feature Requests")

**Version 4.x introduces new installation instructions.**

Once installed (see below for instructions), the system may be configured to automatically create local WordPress user accounts and blogs.  Both the automatic creation of users and the automatic creation of blogs are configurable options.

LDAP authentication is configured on a site-wide (as opposed to per-blog) level, so only Network Admin accounts have access to the configuration to LDAP connection information.

Please make sure you have PHP compiled with LDAP support.  This will show up as an LDAP section in your phpinfo() if it is correct.

Remember - all the code for the plugin was contributed by volunteers, and you can show your gratitude by giving back to the community!

== How It Works ==

When enabled, this plugin can automatically create WordPress user accounts and blogs for LDAP-authenticated users.  Assuming user credentials authenticate against the LDAP server, creating local accounts and blogs follows this
algorithm:

Create a new WPMU User, with LDAP username and a randomly generated password.
Some user information, such as first and last name, is extracted from the
  information returned from the LDAP server.
Actions for user creation and activation are triggered.
The user's domain / URL are created depending on plugin configuration (i.e.,
  VHost vs SubDir).
If the option is set, a blog is created, with path and name based on the LDAP
  username and the blog is activated with the user being Administrator, and
  appropriate actions are triggered.

It should be noted that even though a random password is created for a user (for WPMU accounts), it is never displayed to the user.  This is intentional so that there is no confusion as to which password should be used; it will always be using LDAP credentials.  As a result, though, if ever LDAP is disabled or if the server is unavailable, users created with LDAP authentication will be unable to log in unless their passwords are reset.

== Installation ==

= New Installation = 

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Unzip the plugin contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/post-expirator/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It is recommended to also change the welcome message that is sent to users upon account creation.  By default, WordPress includes the user's password in the message, even though this password is *not* used by this plugin.  The password sent is purely the password attached to the WPMU account that ties to the user's LDAP login.  To change the welcome message, log in as a Network Admin and go to Network Admin -> Options, and edit "Welcome Email" appropriately.

= Migrating from older versions =

If you currently have the WPMU Ldap Authentication plugin configured, migration is fairly simple

1. Make sure you have a network admin enabled non-ldap account setup and available in the blog
2. Remove the current plugin from mu-plugins (all configuration options will stay in the WP database)
3. Install version 4.x of the plugin into the standard plugins folder
4. Network Activate the plugin
5. Thats it! The plugin should now be re-activated with all of your previous settings.
