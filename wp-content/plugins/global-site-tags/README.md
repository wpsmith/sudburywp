## About

Global Site Tags pulls together the most popular tags from across a Multisite network to generate a tag cloud.

Discover new authors, finding new content and following trends. Provide a visually interesting element to your site and increase function and usability with a cloud list. Engage readers with a list that scales font-size to reflect use and popularity.

### Automated setup and management

When activated a tags page displaying your new global cloud is added to your main site. As trends shift, or new tags are added, the list instantly updates across your entire network. Click on a tag and display an ordered list of posts that includes the authors avatar. Paginate settings make for a clean, simple search experience.

### Designed to style-match

Global Site Tags is designed to use your themeâ€™s stylesheet allowing each element to appear native to your site. For fine-tune control, a settings panel is added to network settings. Set the number of tags you want to display, how many posts are listed when a tag is clicked and a custom color palette. Share a global site tag list across your entire network using the built-in widget. Configure to display uniquely for each widget area. Add a fun, interesting way for users to discover even more blogs, content and authors across your Multisite network.

 On the off chance the page isn't auto created all you need to do is create a page with the slug \"tags\" without the quotes if the plugin fails to auto-create the page.
