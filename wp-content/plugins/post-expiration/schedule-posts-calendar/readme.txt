== Description ==

Adds a JavaScript calendar to the scheduled publish widget to allow you to select a date and time graphically instead of via the text entry boxes.

This plugin uses the gpl'd dhtmlxcalendar (http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxCalendar/index.shtml) for the calendar control.

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the schedule-posts-calendar folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What browsers are supported? =

Try it and find out, the JavaScript to insert the calendar is pretty standard and has been tested on:

	* IE9 (note, do NOT use compatibility mode)
	* Opera 11.6+
	* FireFox 10+

If you are using IE in compatibility mode the calendar will overlap other areas, disable compatibility mode.
